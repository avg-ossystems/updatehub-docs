# Package Details

In the `Package Details` page the user may have a deeper look into a particular `Package` and its information.

Beyond the information already present on the `Package List`, you will find more data about the `Objects` and their details which is used by the **UpdateHub** agent during the object's installation.

Once you entered in the `Package Details` you have the option to remove the package from the `Rollout` if necessary by clicking on the _trash can_ icon. The package will be visible and accessible but won't be available anymore.
