# Creating a Rollout

To create a rollout you just need to follow a few steps as described next. If you take a look in the Creating a New Rollout \(below\), on the top there is a link + CREATE ROLLOUT and if you click on it the rollout screen will be visible.

In figure below you can see a part of a rollout screen where you will select if you want to use the advanced rollout settings.

Here you need choose if you save a rollout or if you save and start. The difference is that you just save, the rollout will not start immediately.
