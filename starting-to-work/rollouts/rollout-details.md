# Rollout Details

The **UpdateHub** also gives all the information with the details of each specific `Rollout`, allowing a complete overview of the individual process. Among the information displayed inside the `Rollout Details` you will find:

* _Version_: The version of `Rollout` that the `Device` will receive.
* _Creation Date_: The date that the `Rollout` was created.
* _Tasks_: This area shows the each task that is part of the `Rollout`. Each task includes a number of information, such as:
  * _Number of `Devices`_: All the `Devices` available for the `Rollout`, including the number of process concluded, failed, and remaining in one or various tasks are displayed here.
  * _Fault tolerance_: that's the percentage limit of failures which can occur during the `Rollout` until the **UpdateHub** aborts the running rollout process, including any pending tasks.
* _Play/Pause `Rollout`_: Whenever the user wants to play or pause the `Rollout` the option is available, unless the process is aborted or the user chooses to archive it.
* _Archive the `Rollout`_: Once the rollout is not necessary anymore it can be archived and stopped definitely.
