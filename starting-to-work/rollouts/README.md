# Rollouts

The `Rollout` is essentially a deployment plan. It can be simple as "send version 2.0 for all devices" or complex selecting specific filters and enforcing a gradual deployment across the devices set.  

It is a fast way to update all your devices at once every time you need. No matter how many devices you have to update, you only have to do it once and **UpdateHub** will update all for you.
