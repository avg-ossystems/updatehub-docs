# Device Details


The `Device Details` page provides you access to detailed information about a specific `Device` such as:

* The Unique Identifier \(UID\)
* The device identity values \(e.g. MAC\* address, CPU serial number or other\)
* Current installed package version
* Hardware model
* Device state \(enabled or disabled\)
* Device attributes

Besides the device information, the `Rollout` history of the device allow an easy access to the current and previous device's update status, such as duration, logs about errors and date of the events.

During a normal situation the device `Rollout` will be displayed showing the moment that started, going through all the process until the point that is finished, like in the image below:

In the case of some kind of problem happens during the update process, the **UpdateHub** will provide a visual feedback of the moment it occured. To examine the failure you need to select `See Device Log`.
