# Device Fleet Management

The `Devices` page displays the list of registered devices for the `Product`.

The **UpdateHub** allows the selection of `Devices` to be displayed on the list through the use of filters, therefore granting the user excellent capacity for organization even when managing a great number of them at once. The user has the option to filter `Devices` by their status as active or inactive, identity values, hardware, package version and custom attributes.
