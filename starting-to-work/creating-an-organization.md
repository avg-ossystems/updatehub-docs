# Creating an Organization

After you be logged into your UpdateHub you should create an organization and in this context an organization is not a business company but an organized way of working or we can still say that an organization is a controlled and organized work environment.

To create an organization you need to click on the arrow that is on the right side of your username and a drop down menu will open.

Now select the settings item and you will have a Settings Screen.

Now click on the create organization link.

![Settings Screen](../../.gitbook/assets/settingsscreen.png)

After this a window will open where you should insert the organization name and click on the SAVE button.

![Organization Name](../../.gitbook/assets/organizationname.png)

Now we have created an organization.

The next step is to request the access key, then just click on the request access key link.

Now choose a name to your key \(it is optional\) and select the organization that you were created.

> _Pay attention to do not choose the single owner, because if you select it further up you could not use this key in your organization work._

Just press the SAVE button and you will see the organization key to use in your project.

>_Before you press the close button copy the keys!_

After you close the screen you wonâ€™t be able to see them again and you will request a new key again.

You can copy each key individually for use in your product or you can copy the keys along with the variables to use within your Yocto Project.

This can be easily done in either case with just one click on the square that is right next to each key.

After you press the close button you will come back to the settings window where you can see now the organization name, who is the owner of the key, the last use of the key, how long time it was created and a trash icon if you want to delete the key.

So far we already have an organization set up and we've got the keys to use in our project, but in order to really work we need to create products.
