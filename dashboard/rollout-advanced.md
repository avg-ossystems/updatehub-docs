# Advanced Rollouts

Whenever you need more control over the `Rollout` of a several `Devices` at once use the option `Advanced Mode`.

Follow the steps ahead:

* Fist click on _Create a New Rollout_
* When the window shows up to select the `Rollout` version click on _Advanced Mode_
* A `Task` will be automatically generated
* Use the filters offered by the updatehub
* Indicate `Fault Tolerance` percentage
* Filter `Devices` by their:
  * Version
  * Hardware
  * Device Identifier \(e.g: the MAC address\)
  * Device Attributes \(e.g: kernel version, device total memory\)
* With multiple `Tasks` define the policy to begin new update processes by setting the starting point when a selected percentage of it is reached and the user can set if it must begin automatically or manually
* `Save` the `Rollout` to start later or `Save and Start` it immediately

It is important to bear in mind that you can create as many `Tasks` as possible as long there is `Devices` available for the `Rollout` and choose names for each individual `Task` in order to organize and identify them.
