# Creating a Rollout

There are two methods to execute the `Rollout`.

The simpler way shows all the versions of the `Devices` present on the field to be updated at once.

You just need to go to the `Overview` or `Rollouts` page and click on `Create Rollout`. A box to choose the *version* will appear. After you make this choice just click on `Save` to initiate the `Rollout` later or `Save and Start` launch it straightaway.

Keep in mind that this method will trigger the `Rollout` for all the `Devices` accessible for the `Product` chosen, with no restrictions concerning the different hardware or other aspects of the fleet on the field. If the user desires to select which equipment receives the `Rollout` the **UpdateHub** offers the `Advanced Rollout` option.

If you prefer or if you have some doubt you can follow the below steps to work just one device.

To create a rollout you just need to follow a few steps as described next. If you take a look in the Creating a New Rollout \(below\), on the top there is a link + CREATE ROLLOUT and if you click on it the rollout screen will be visible.

Now you can see the versions of your devices and select which one is that you will use in your rollout.

In figure below you can see a part of a rollout screen where you will select if you want to use the advanced rollout settings.

Here you need choose if you save a rollout or if you save and start. The difference is that you just save, the rollout will not start immediately.
