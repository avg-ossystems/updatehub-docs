# Creating a Product

The basis that connects all together through the **UpdateHub** is the`Product`. Essentially the Product includes one or multiple `Devices` and for each of them there is a `Package` version that may be updated using a `Rollout`.

* To create one product click on the BACK TO PRODUCTS link  and you will be again in the welcome screen.

* Now you should press the add product button and fill the form with your product name and the owner.

* Here you should use the organization because after you create a product you can not deleted it, so have sure you are choosing the correct owner.

>_If you want to create a product that you will use in a single job, just select the product owner as “Me”, but remember that you can not transfer the products to the organization or vice versa._

* After you select the product owner you need press the create button and “voilà” your first organization product is created.

* After you press the OK button you will be into the products screen where you can see all your products, rollouts, devices and packages.
