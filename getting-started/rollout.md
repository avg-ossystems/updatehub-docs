# Creating a rollout

A `Rollout` is a fast way to update all your devices at once. No matter how many devices you have to update, you only have to do it once and **UpdateHub** will update all for you.

To create a `Rollout` you just need to follow a few steps as described next.

If you take a look at the figure below, on the top there is a link `+ CREATE ROLLOUT` and if you click on it the rollout screen will be visible.
