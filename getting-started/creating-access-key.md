# Creating an Access Key



To authenticate and authorize requests for a project build with the **UpdateHub** you must have a security credential in the form of an application access key.

Each access key is specific to your user and is used to upload the packages update or any other external integration which needs to access the **UpdateHub** API.

In order to generate an Access Key you must follow the steps in the next section DASHBOARD creating an [Acces Key](../dashboard/access-key.md).
